        <div class="left">Hello! My name is Saloni Singh, and I am an aspiring Full-Stack Developer with a passion for
          building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications.
          <br>
          I have hands-on experience with front-end frameworks like React and back-end technologies such as Node.js and
          MongoDB, enabling me to create dynamic web applications.
          <br>
          My journey in software development has also led me to gain proficiency in programming languages such as
          Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript, which have equipped me to solve problems and develop innovative solutions.
          <br>
          I am constantly learning and evolving, and I am excited to contribute my skills to the tech industry while
          growing as a developer.
          <br>
          Let’s build something amazing together!
